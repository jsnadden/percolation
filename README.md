# Pycolation

- **2D Bond Percolation Model**  
  Generate pseudorandom square grids with a given size and bond probability  
  
- **Computes topological/graph-theoretic features**  
  Efficiently identify clusters, compute graph diameters etc.
  
- **Visualisation**  
  Output various graphical representations of the generated grids, e.g. showing cluster formation,

- **Stat-mech simulation (in progress)**  
  Compute macroscopic quantities (average cluster diameter etc.), plotting them against model parameters, e.g. to see the phase transition at p=0.5
